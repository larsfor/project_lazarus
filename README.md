# Project Lazarus

A personal project for me to become better at web development. The main goal is to produce a page where one can login and go through several different exercises and guides within both technical and business areas - for example, Excel, Python, SQL and other topics one might encounter during a work day. A future idea is also to have quizes for you to test yourself or prepare to a job interview or job situation.

This site is created with:
* Ruby on Rails 3
* Devise (for authentication)
* Vite + React for frontend
